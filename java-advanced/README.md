This program will provide you with technical hands-on knowledge of Java Core 8-17 versions, advanced multithreading, monitoring and troubleshooting, reactive programming, testing and code quality.

What you will learn:
- Starting from Java 8, navigate through important Java releases, new language features, removals, and deprecations, and make well-informed decisions about moving beyond Java 8.
- Minimize code vulnerability, test coverage improvements, comprehensive code inspections, standardize code style, heads-up, and mindset on code quality as a practice.
- Understand test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD), and explain their benefits, develop unit tests with test assertions and test fixtures and then run them, and improve unit testing through coverage reports and mock objects.
- Java multithreaded programming and memory model, basic and advanced synchronization primitives, learn common concurrent problems, and effective ways of dealing with them.
- How to use monitoring for your Java applications, troubleshoot memory problems in Java applications, and do JVM performance tuning.
- Basics and benefits of using reactive programming in Java, and building reactive web apps with Spring Boot and Spring WebFlux.
